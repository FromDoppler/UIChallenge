# UI Developer Challenge!

## Tasks
The client has asked you to create an user experience as a lading page structure, where simplicity and ease-of-use are at the forefront of the design and implementation. Deliver the complete experience using HTML, CSS and JS in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile, but you'll only receive a desktop mockup since we want you to solve the responsive behavior. Provide clear explanations about your decision-making process for the responsive approach; document code as much as possible as well. You have to use a task runner to automatize something of your choice and you have to use a pre-processor such as SASS or LESS. *You can't use CSS frameworks/toolkits nor JS plugins*.
 
## Deliverables
* Complete project files working on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge, all of them on the latest version and the previous one.
* At least one component made with CSS only.
* At least one animation made with CSS only.
* Perform a Global Project Optimization before submit it.

## Tips
* You can deliver everything else you consider necessary to support your solution.
* Consider using CSS rather than JS for motion and interaction solutions.
* Pay special attention to the details.
